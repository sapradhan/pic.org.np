Treating pesticide exposure in the eye is a critical and time-sensitive process that requires immediate action to minimize potential damage. If pesticide comes into contact with the eye, follow these steps:

1. **Flush the Eye with Water:** The first and most crucial step is to immediately rinse the affected eye with lukewarm, clean, and gently flowing water for at least 15 minutes. Ensure that the water stream covers the entire eye and reaches the inner corner, where the pesticide may be trapped. You can use a clean cup or a specialized eye wash station if available. The goal is to flush out the pesticide and dilute any remaining chemicals. Do not use hot or cold water, as extreme temperatures can further damage the eye.

2. **Seek Medical Attention:** After thorough irrigation, seek immediate medical attention. Even if the symptoms seem to improve or disappear, it is crucial to have a medical professional examine the eye to assess the extent of damage and provide appropriate treatment. Pesticides can cause severe eye injuries, and only a healthcare provider can determine the best course of action, which may include further irrigation, the use of eye drops, or other treatments to prevent complications and ensure the eye heals properly. Avoid rubbing or putting any medications or ointments in the eye unless directed by a medical professional, as this can exacerbate the damage.

> Prompt and proper treatment is essential when dealing with pesticide exposure in the eye, as it can help prevent long-term damage and protect your vision. Always take precautions to prevent accidental exposure to pesticides, such as wearing appropriate protective gear and following safety guidelines when handling these chemicals.
